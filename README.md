How could I only get **581** on my e-ink device, even though it runs at **21 FPS**?
So I have to have my own one. Now I can have much higher scores...

The sprites are from [loparcog/chrome-dinosaur](https://github.com/loparcog/chrome-dinosaur) and soundtracks (sound effects) are from [The sounds resource](https://www.sounds-resource.com/browser_games/googlechromedinosaurgame/sound/18002/).

The running soundtrack generated by script:

```python
import numpy as np
import scipy.io.wavfile as wavfile

sample_rate = 44100
duration = 0.3
pulse_width = 100
pulse_gap = 15000

signal = np.zeros(int(sample_rate * duration))
for start in range(0, len(signal), pulse_gap):
    end = min(start + pulse_width, len(signal))
    signal[start:end] += np.hamming(end - start) * 0.8

signal = np.clip(signal, -1, 1)

audio_data = np.int16(signal * 32767)

output_path = "./assets/run.wav"
wavfile.write(output_path, sample_rate, audio_data)
```

## ✨ Features

1. 🦖 Double Jump:

   Dino’s mighty legs let it leap once more while airborne — because why not jump twice? 🕊️🦵💨

1. 🐊 Duck Dino:

   When danger flies high, go low. Ducking lets Dino dodge those pesky birds. 🐦⬇️

1. 😮‍💨 Be Nice to Dino:

   Crawling is exhausting! After 3 seconds of ducking, Dino needs to stand up and catch a breath. 🛌⏱️

1. 🧠 Vim Mode:

   Real pros use K to jump (instead of Space) and J to duck (instead of Down).
   Old habits die hard — muscle memory, engage! 🎮⌨️💪

1. 🏃‍♂️ Run Harder, Die Slower (WIP)
   Earn a revive every 1000 points 🏃‍♂️💨🛡️
   Because Dino deserves it. 😤🦖✨
