How could I only get **581** on my e-ink device, even though it runs at **21 FPS**?
So I have to have my own one. Now I can have much higher scores...

The sprites are from [loparcog/chrome-dinosaur](https://github.com/loparcog/chrome-dinosaur) and soundtracks (sound effects) are from [The sounds resource](https://www.sounds-resource.com/browser_games/googlechromedinosaurgame/sound/18002/).

The running soundtrack generated by script:

```python
import numpy as np
import scipy.io.wavfile as wavfile

sample_rate = 44100
duration = 0.3
pulse_width = 100
pulse_gap = 15000

signal = np.zeros(int(sample_rate * duration))
for start in range(0, len(signal), pulse_gap):
    end = min(start + pulse_width, len(signal))
    signal[start:end] += np.hamming(end - start) * 0.8

signal = np.clip(signal, -1, 1)

audio_data = np.int16(signal * 32767)

output_path = "./assets/run.wav"
wavfile.write(output_path, sample_rate, audio_data)
```
